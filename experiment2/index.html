				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The goal of this experiment was to replicate an image using code in p5.js. We were supposed to do this procedurally so that the program created a different world each time while still resembling the source image. We also were supposed to animate it in some way to make it a living world.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The trees are made using basic shapes in a way that they can be scaled up and down. I then have a grid of points with random offsets that I try to spawn trees on. I then only spawn trees that are between two noise functions. I do this twice, once for each side. The noise functions add to a mostly diagonal line, which makes the hills sloped. The mountain in the back is made using a noise function that drops off at the edges. The snow is a polygon that is at the bounds between another noise function and the mountains. The day/night cycle works by adding a rotation to the sun and moon ellipses. At certain points in the rotation, the background fades between different states. This is all sped up by grouping shapes that are on the same layer and drawing them all at once.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The most interesting thing I learned in this experiment was how to group shapes. This allows me to draw a ton of shapes while still being performant. I used that for the trees in this project. One challenge that I faced was having the fullscreen work on this webpage. I eventually solved it, but I needed to change the premade js.</p>

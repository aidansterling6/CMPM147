				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>For this experiment, the goal was to create an evolutional system that converges on an image. I was trying to get a very detailed final output with color.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This one was pretty simple. I changed the p5 version that was running because the default was much slower than more recent versions. I copy pasted the code for the slider bars and made two new ones. I am just creating 1000 rectangles and mutating their position, color, and alpha. I am also using one of the sliders to determine how many mutations to make. I am using randomGaussian for mutations.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I feel like Iâ€™m over all really happy with how it turned out, but it could use some tuning. It still takes a really long time to get to a reasonable image. I do really like how good the final products look though. If I redid it, I would probably scrap the premade code and write it myself. It seems really slow and I could have more flexibility if I didn't use it. I could also try to do something with shaders to make it really fast. Another thing I would do is come up with a better algorithm for mutating things. It currently just does it randomly but there are algorithms that try and do more of good mutations. Overall I tuned mine for really good final images and I think I succeeded.</p>
